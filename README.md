## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the code for **Lab 2** in CSE 120. The lab focuses on **collecting user input** and storing it in **lists**.  

The program prompts the user to:  
1. Enter **5 numbers**, which are validated to ensure they are integers  
2. Enter **5 animal names**, stored as strings  

The goal of this exercise was to practice:  
- Using **loops** (`while`) for repeated input  
- Validating user input with **try/except**  
- Storing and displaying **data in lists**
